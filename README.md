# Stock-Trading-Strategy
Predicting the next day’s stock price based on stock movements and options data from the previous day. The goal is to beat the buy-and-hold trading strategy. 

# Project Description
The objective of this project is to construct a short-term stock price prediction model based on historical stock price data and options market data, aiming to forecast the stock price trend for the next trading day. This project will utilize stock trading information from the previous trading day, including opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, trading volume, etc., as well as options market-related data, such as implied volatility, options trading volume, put/call ratio, etc., as the main input features.
In terms of methodology, the project will utilize statistical analysis and machine learning models to establish a correlation model between stock prices and option data, and predict the direction or magnitude of stock price changes on the next trading day. Based on the prediction results, corresponding trading strategies will be further designed, and historical data will be used to backtest their actual performance.

# Clear goals
The primary objective of this project is to utilize stock price trends from the previous trading day and option market data to successfully predict stock price movements for the next trading day, and to construct a trading model that outperforms the buy-and-hold strategy in historical backtesting.
Specific objectives include:
1. Construct a feature system encompassing stock trading data and options market indicators;
2. Train a predictive model to determine the trend or magnitude of stock price changes on the next trading day;
3. Design an executable trading strategy based on the prediction results;
4. Through historical backtesting, compare the performance of this strategy in terms of return and risk with that of the buy-and-hold strategy to verify its effectiveness.
